# Poteto help

Answer the user's question about pi-pstack, hand them a prompt they can send, and link the file the answer came from. For a help question, don't start the work. The user asked how, and a pstack run spends real tokens, so let them send the prompt.

A message that asks for work, such as "use pstack to fix this bug", is not a help question. Read [`poteto-mode`](../poteto-mode/SKILL.md) and do the work under it.

This file maps questions to the skills that hold the answers. Those files own the details. Read the file you route to before you quote it, and trust it when it disagrees with this map. The links here point into the installed plugin, which the user may not be able to open, so give the user the file's public copy: `https://github.com/casualjim/pi-mimir/tree/main/packages/pi-pstack/` followed by its path.

## Find out what they need

Infer the need from the message and the conversation. A named situation, such as "which skill reviews a PR?", goes straight to its section. If the need is still unclear, ask one multiple-choice question with these options, then answer only the section they pick:

- Get set up
- Start a task with `/skill:poteto-mode`
- Pick a skill for a situation
- Fix a run that went wrong
- Make pi-pstack my own

Check the state that changes the answer, and mention it only when it does:

- No role-to-model routing configured through `subagents_write_task_models` means every role runs on the parent model (`inherit-parent`), which is the cheapest default.
- No `verify-*` skill or other app harness in the project means agents have no scripted way to drive the app. Mention `/skill:create-verification-skill` when the question is about proving a change works.

When cost is the worry, say where the tokens go and how to spend fewer. pstack spends extra tokens on subagents and review panels. Configure cheaper models per role through `subagents_write_task_models` (pi-herdr-agents' `models.tasks`/`models.agents` config); a role left unconfigured runs on the chat's model. A shorter panel list runs fewer subagents, one for each entry. Save `/skill:poteto-mode` for work that needs rigor.

## Get set up

1. Install the plugin (`@casualjim/pi-pstack`) into the agent host. It registers its skills and publishes `poteto-agent` and `comment-sicko` to pi-herdr-agents as a role pack.
2. Optionally configure per-role models with `subagents_write_task_models`. Unconfigured roles inherit the parent model.
3. Start a real task with `/skill:poteto-mode`, a goal, and a check that can pass or fail.

Installing changes nothing until the user invokes a skill. The [README](../../README.md) has the details, including how delegation routes through pi-herdr-agents' `subagent` tool. Offer to word their first prompt with them, per [`references/prompting.md`](references/prompting.md).

## Start a task with `/skill:poteto-mode`

`/skill:poteto-mode` matches the task to a playbook, copies the playbook's steps into the task list, and runs the other skills as the steps need them. A step it skips stays in the list as `skip: <reason>`. A good prompt states the goal and how to tell it's done. It doesn't list skills, because a hand-written sequence tends to drop or reorder steps the playbook would keep. Read [`references/prompting.md`](references/prompting.md) before you help word one.

The skill loads for the session when invoked. Start each new task with `/skill:poteto-mode` again; a phrase like "new task" makes the mode match a fresh playbook mid-chat. `/skill:poteto-mode` already uses `poteto-agent` for the subagents its playbook steps spawn. To get the same style from a subagent of your own, spawn it with `agent: "poteto-agent"`.

## Pick a skill

The default answer is `/skill:poteto-mode`, which runs most of the others when its steps need them. Name a skill directly when the user wants more or less of something than the playbook gives. Read the skill before you recommend it, and give one example prompt.

If a skill directory next to this one is missing from the table, read its frontmatter and route by its description. The `principle-*` directories are covered under principles below.

Close calls:

- `/skill:how` explains what the code does. `/skill:why` explains the reasons. `/skill:teach` runs one or both and explains the result plainly.
- `/skill:arena` gives every worker the same brief and merges the best parts. `/skill:swarm` splits work into slices or a race and returns one report.
- `/skill:architect` implements right after it settles the design. Add "with checkpoint" to review the design before it writes code.
- `/skill:interrogate` reviews the diff. `/skill:blast-radius` looks for breakage outside the diff and proves the one fact that makes the change safe.
- `/skill:recall` rebuilds context across recent chats. `/skill:ketchup` covers only this chat since the user's last message. Resuming one specific chat or branch is the Session pickup playbook.
- `/skill:figure-it-out` designs one rigorous run. The Orchestrate playbook runs a program that spans days and many PRs. The Autonomous run playbook drives one task to a finish condition.

## Playbooks and principles

Playbooks are step lists inside `/skill:poteto-mode`, not skills, so they have no slash command. Inside `/skill:poteto-mode`, describing the task picks one, and these phrases name one directly:

- "babysit this pr" or "check on pr 123" runs Babysit. It drives the PR to merge-ready and stops there. It doesn't merge unless the user asks to merge, land, or ship.
- "land the stack" runs Shipping.
- "take over this branch" runs Session pickup.
- "pause safely" runs Pause safely.
- "full autopilot on this queue" runs Autopilot-full. "stack them, don't ship" runs Autopilot-stack.
- "run the eval playbook" runs Eval.

The Playbooks section of [`poteto-mode`](../poteto-mode/SKILL.md) lists every playbook and when it applies.

For work that spans phases or stacked PRs, asking `/skill:poteto-mode` for a plan runs the [Multi-phase plan playbook](../poteto-mode/playbooks/multi-phase-plan.md), which writes the plan and doesn't implement it. For a design question, the Prototype playbook or `/skill:architect` settles it in code first.

Principles are one-rule skills that `/skill:poteto-mode` reads and cites in its replies. The user rarely invokes one. They steer with the names instead, as in "apply prove it works. show me the real output."

## Fix a run that went wrong

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| A question got treated as the next step of the last task | Say "new task", or say the turn doesn't need the mode. |
| A new model choice had no effect | Role-to-model routing applies to new subagent spawns. Check `subagents_write_task_models` took effect. |
| Runs cost more than expected | See the cost paragraph under Get set up. |
| A skill didn't load on its own | Skills load when the user types them or when `/skill:poteto-mode` runs them, and it doesn't run every skill. |
| Parallel agents overwrote each other | Give each agent its own worktree, per the separate-before-serializing-shared-state principle. |
| An overnight run moved but finished nothing | `/loop` needs a check that can pass or fail, not a duration. |
| The reply claims success from a green build | Ask for the real command, flow, stored value, or profile. That's the prove-it-works principle. |

For a run that drifts, [`references/prompting.md`](references/prompting.md) has one-line steers.

## Make pi-pstack my own

- [`/skill:automate-me`](../automate-me/SKILL.md) drafts a personal mode skill from the user's own history, to use alongside `/skill:poteto-mode`.
- [`/skill:reflect`](../reflect/SKILL.md) after a session turns its lessons into skill edits the user approves.
- `/skill:poteto-mode write a skill for <workflow>` runs the authoring playbook. The eval playbook tests a skill change blind.
- Fix a misbehaving skill in its own PR, not inside the feature work where it went wrong.

## Reply

Lead with the answer. Give at most one example prompt in a code block, adapted from [`references/recipes.md`](references/recipes.md) when one fits, then the link to that file. Keep it short unless the user asked for the whole map.
